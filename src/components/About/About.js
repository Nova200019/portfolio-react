            My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion for web-developement, which led me to pursue the Applied Artificial intelligence program. Despite the hard work, I remained determined and forged lasting friendships that supported me throughout this demanding program.
            Throughout my studies at TH Rosenheim, I had the opportunity to engage in fascinating projects. Notably, I contributed to the development of the Media Infrastructure at German Aerospace center, project that garnered recognition from my colleagues, instructors, and clients alike.
